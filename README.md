A Simple Command Line Based ProjectBuilt by me in my journey of learning to code almost a year ago! The project is simple but the learning outcomes were quite subtle and informative.
Programming languages used - python
Currently the system is not connected to a backend database or any relational database system such as MySQL or non relational databases like MongoDB.
However I might update the project in future, currently focusing on building blockchain application and applications intense enough to learn and grow in the field of computer science of ML/AI and Data Science.

If you like this project feel free to dm me on twitter on instagram for collaboration or any kind of effort you might be wondering is worth my skillset:
